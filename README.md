Bug noticed: in the `zodiacguess` block, the system seems to be a bit buggy - it does not react to the 'help' statement even though it should be. Changing the order of blocks in `RECOGNIZED` makes the system always refer the player back to the instructions. It should not be like this even though the code seems correct.
